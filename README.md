## Features

### **:balloon: Ultra-lightweight**

Handles state management, physics, entities and camera tracking out-of-the-box,
with no external dependencies.
 
### **:mount_fuji: Slope support**

Supports 45 degree floor and ceiling slopes, and new tile types can easily be
added.

### **:electric_plug: Extendible component-based entity system**

Entities can easily be extended with additional properties and behaviour using a
flexible component-based system.

### **:books: Easily integrate with any GUI / rendering / input library**

Window creation, rendering and input handling are abstracted; the engine is not
tied to any existing libraries.

## Getting Started

A demo project using the Java Swing library is included, but the basic steps are
detailed [here](docs/intro.md).
